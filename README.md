    Reaper - An ADB-based botnet written in C.
</h1>
<p align="center">
	Reaper is an ADB-based botnet that lets control the devices you infect, execute commands, and contains extra tools for playing around. It isn't just limited 
	to ADB, it can be used as a telnet botnet, or a regular botnet.

## Why?

Here are few reasons why I made this:
```
	- I wanted to learn more about botnets.
	- I wanted to make something that will help other people understand and learn more about botnets.
	- Most botnets that are available on github are all variants of mirai or qbot, so I wanted to make my own from scratch.
```
Extra Facts:
```
	- Yes, I know, I could've used epoll, but I didn't want to make things super-complicated and annoying.
	- No, this does not contain any DDoS methods, If you want to customize this and add your own, then you are free to do so.
